# Numpy.Random Package in Python:
Numpy.random is a tool used in python to generate a random selection of numbers or random datasets. There are various differentiations of numpy.random which generate a vast variety of random numbers.These random number generators are suitable for generating numbers for spacial and graphical distributions. Numpy.random has various distributions which are useful for generating random exponential number or integers.

Permutations are useful for randomly re-arranging a list of numbers within a range. Seeds are also useful in generating random numbers that consistently remain the same as long as the seed does not change. This is useful when testing in order to ensure your results are accurate.


# How to use Jupyter Notebook:
To run the script to invesigate the Numpy.random package and it's functions within Jupyter you must have already downloaded Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) and Python (https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python). 

1. Please find the script in the file programming assignment.ipynb within the Programming for Data Analysis Depository. Copy this code and save to a new file or download it. Name it as you desire
2. Open Visual Studio Code (VSC). To open the Integrated Terminal, click View and then click the integrated terminal or alternatively use the shortcut cntrl +'.
3. Type jupyter notebook into the Intergrated Terminal and press enter. A new internet tab will be opened.
4. In the Notebook Dashboard navigate to find the notebook: clicking on its name will open it in a new browser tab.
5. You can run the notebook document step-by-step (one cell a time) by clicking on a cell and pressing shift + enter. An sterisk between two square brackets [*] will appear when the code is running. Once the code is run a number will appear between two square brackets eg [1].
6. You can run the whole notebook in a single step by clicking on the menu Cell -> Run All.
7. To restart the kernel (i.e. the computational engine), click on the menu Kernel -> Restart. This can be useful to start over a computation from scratch (e.g. variables are deleted, open files are closed, etc.).

# Results:
Numpy.random can be used for generating various forms of random data. These functions are discussed in more detai in the jupyter notebook file. 

The use of seeds are also discussed in greater detai in the jupyter notebook file.
