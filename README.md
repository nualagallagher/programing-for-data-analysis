Numpy.random is a tool used in python to generate a random selection of numbers or random datasets. There are various differentiations of numpy.random.

Numpy.random.rand generates a random set of numbers between 0 and 1 but not including 1.







Simple Random data is a subset of a statistical population in which each member of the subset has an equal probability of being chosen (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/simple-random-sample.asp). It is due to random selection which is a huge advantage as it is unbiased and there is no need to divide the total population into sub groups etc.
Python comes with a random number generator which can be used to generate various distributions of numbers. These random number generators are suitable for generating numbers for spacial and graphical distributions. To access the random number generators, the random module must be imported.
